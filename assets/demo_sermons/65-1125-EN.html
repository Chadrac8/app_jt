    <h1>THE RAPTURE</h1>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> November 25, 1965 (Thanksgiving)</p>
    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Shreveport, Louisiana, USA</p>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Thank you, Brother. Good evening, friends. It's a privilege to be here this Thanksgiving evening. I'm very thankful to the Lord for this opportunity to share His Word with you on this special occasion.</p>
    
    <p>Tonight I want to speak on the subject of "The Rapture." This is one of the most blessed hopes of the Church - the catching away of the Bride of Christ.</p>
    
    <h2>What is the Rapture?</h2>
    <p>The Rapture is that glorious event when Jesus Christ will come for His Church. It's not the Second Coming - that comes later. The Rapture is the secret coming of the Lord for His Bride.</p>
    
    <p>1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 tells us: "For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord."</p>
    
    <h2>The three stages of His Coming</h2>
    <p>We must understand that Christ's coming happens in three stages:</p>
    
    <p><strong>1. The secret Rapture of the Bride</strong> - This is when He comes FOR His saints. It's a secret, quiet event. Only those who are watching and waiting will know.</p>
    
    <p><strong>2. The Revelation</strong> - This is when He comes WITH His saints. The world will see Him then. Every eye shall see Him.</p>
    
    <p><strong>3. The Millennium reign</strong> - After the tribulation, Christ will establish His kingdom on earth for a thousand years.</p>
    
    <h2>The Bride makes herself ready</h2>
    <p>Revelation 19:7 says: "Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready."</p>
    
    <p>Notice: The Bride makes HERSELF ready. How does she do this?</p>
    
    <p><strong>Through the Word</strong> - The Bride is washed by the water of the Word. She lives by every Word that proceeds from the mouth of God.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Through holiness</strong> - Without holiness, no man shall see the Lord. The Bride keeps herself unspotted from the world.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Through watching</strong> - Jesus said to watch and pray always. The wise virgins had oil in their lamps and were ready when the Bridegroom came.</p>
    
    <h2>The call at midnight</h2>
    <p>Matthew 25 tells us about the midnight cry: "Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him." This cry goes forth in the darkest hour, just before the dawn.</p>
    
    <p>We're living in that midnight hour right now. The darkness is great, but the light is shining brighter for those who have eyes to see.</p>
    
    <h2>The transformation</h2>
    <p>1 Corinthians 15:51-52 reveals a mystery: "Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed."</p>
    
    <p>This mortal body will put on immortality. This corruptible will put on incorruption. What a glorious transformation! In a moment, faster than you can blink your eye, we'll be changed and caught up to meet Him.</p>
    
    <h2>Who will go in the Rapture?</h2>
    <p>Not everyone who calls themselves a Christian will go in the Rapture. Jesus said in Matthew 7:21: "Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven."</p>
    
    <p>The Rapture is for the Bride - those who have made themselves ready, those who are filled with the Holy Spirit, those who are living by the Word.</p>
    
    <p>It's for those who have come out of the denominational systems and are following the Lamb wherever He goes.</p>
    
    <h2>The signs we're living in the last days</h2>
    <p>Jesus told us there would be signs of His coming. We see them all around us today:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Moral decay</strong> - As it was in the days of Noah and Lot, so shall it be. The world is filled with violence and immorality.</p>
    
    <p><strong>False prophets</strong> - Many are deceiving people with false doctrines and signs and wonders.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Wars and rumors of wars</strong> - Nation rising against nation, just as Jesus predicted.</p>
    
    <p><strong>The restoration of Israel</strong> - The fig tree has put forth her branches. Israel is back in her homeland.</p>
    
    <p><strong>The revelation of the mysteries</strong> - God is revealing the hidden truths of His Word to prepare the Bride.</p>
    
    <h2>Are you ready?</h2>
    <p>The question tonight is: Are you ready for the Rapture? Have you made yourself ready? Are you watching and waiting?</p>
    
    <p>Don't be caught sleeping like the foolish virgins. Don't be too busy with the cares of this world. Keep your lamp trimmed and burning. Keep oil in your vessel.</p>
    
    <p>The Bridegroom is coming! It could be tonight. It could be tomorrow. But one thing is certain - He IS coming!</p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>As we gather here on this Thanksgiving evening, let us be thankful that we have this blessed hope. Let us be thankful that we know the truth. Let us be thankful that we're part of that Bride that's making herself ready.</p>
    
    <p>Soon, very soon, we're going to hear that shout from heaven. The dead in Christ will rise first, and we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds.</p>
    
    <p>What a glorious day that will be! No more sickness, no more sorrow, no more death. We'll be with Jesus forever.</p>
    
    <p>Let us pray: Dear Heavenly Father, we thank You for this blessed hope of the Rapture. Help us to make ourselves ready. Keep us faithful and watching. Come quickly, Lord Jesus. In Your holy name we pray, Amen.</p>
    
    <p><em>God bless you. Watch and pray. The coming of the Lord draweth nigh.</em></p>
