    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Good evening, friends. It's truly a privilege to be here tonight and to be able to share God's Word with you. Tonight, I would like to speak on a very important subject: "The God of This Evil Age."</p>
    
    <p>You know, the Bible tells us in 2 Corinthians 4:4: "In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them."</p>
    
    <h2>Who is the god of this age?</h2>
    <p>Many people wonder: "Who is this god that the apostle Paul is talking about?" He's not talking about Almighty God, the Creator of heaven and earth. No, he's talking about Satan, the adversary, the one who has exalted himself against God and who rules over this world system.</p>
    
    <p>Jesus Himself called him "the prince of this world" in John 14:30. He said: "Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me."</p>
    
    <h2>How does Satan blind minds?</h2>
    <p>Satan blinds the minds of men in several ways:</p>
    
    <p><strong>1. Through unbelief</strong> - Satan's first weapon is to make people doubt God's Word. He started in the Garden of Eden by saying to Eve: "Hath God said?" That's still his tactic today.</p>
    
    <p><strong>2. Through traditions</strong> - Jesus said to the Pharisees: "Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition" (Matthew 15:6). Satan uses religious traditions to keep people away from the pure truth of the Word.</p>
    
    <p><strong>3. Through worldly pleasures</strong> - In the parable of the sower, Jesus speaks of the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches that choke the Word. Satan uses distractions and temporary pleasures to turn hearts away from God.</p>
    
    <h2>Satan's world system</h2>
    <p>Brothers and sisters, we must understand that Satan has established a complete system in this world. This system encompasses:</p>
    
    <p><strong>The political system</strong> - All the nations of the world are under his influence. That's why Jesus refused the kingdoms of the world that Satan offered Him in the wilderness, because they belonged to him.</p>
    
    <p><strong>The economic system</strong> - The love of money is the root of all evil. Satan controls the commerce and finance of this world.</p>
    
    <p><strong>The religious system</strong> - This is perhaps the most dangerous, because it gives an appearance of godliness while denying its power. Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.</p>
    
    <h2>The light of the glorious Gospel</h2>
    <p>But glory to God! For those of us who believe, the veil has been removed. We can see the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ. This light reveals:</p>
    
    <p><strong>The true nature of God</strong> - Christ is the image of the invisible God. When we see Him, we see the Father.</p>
    
    <p><strong>The plan of redemption</strong> - Through His death and resurrection, Christ destroyed the works of the devil and redeemed us from the enemy's hand.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Our identity in Christ</strong> - We are no longer slaves to sin, but we have become children of God, heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ.</p>
    
    <h2>How to resist the god of this age?</h2>
    <p>The Bible gives us clear instructions:</p>
    
    <p><strong>1. Stay in the Word</strong> - Jesus overcame Satan's temptations by saying "It is written." The Word of God is our sword of the Spirit.</p>
    
    <p><strong>2. Walk in the Spirit</strong> - Romans 8:1 says "There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."</p>
    
    <p><strong>3. Resist the devil</strong> - James 4:7 tells us: "Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you."</p>
    
    <p><strong>4. Keep your eyes on Jesus</strong> - Hebrews 12:2 instructs us to look "unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith."</p>
    
    <h2>The coming judgment</h2>
    <p>We must remember that Satan's reign is temporary. The day is coming when Christ will return in glory and establish His eternal kingdom. Every knee shall bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.</p>
    
    <p>Satan knows his time is short, and that's why he's working with such fury in these last days. But we who believe have the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Dear friends, tonight I want to encourage you: Don't be deceived by the god of this age. Don't let Satan blind your mind to the truth of God's Word. Stand firm in the faith. Put on the whole armor of God.</p>
    
    <p>Remember, greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world. The light of the Gospel has shone in our hearts, and no power of darkness can extinguish it.</p>
    
    <p>Let us pray: Heavenly Father, we thank You for opening our eyes to see the truth. Help us to walk in the light of Your Word and to resist the deceptions of the enemy. In Jesus' name, Amen.</p>
    
    <p><em>May the Lord bless you and keep you. May His face shine upon you and give you peace.</em></p>
